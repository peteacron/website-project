<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

<p>The tool I used in terms of productivity and efficiency was Trello and it has it’s benefits and drawbacks. The benefits include having a visual representation of what my tasks were. The drawbacks were that even though I had my tasks laid out I wasn’t sure how long everything would take so making an accurate time table was difficult. If this was a group project I feel as a whole, the project would be run more efficiently. Being able to delegate tasks between team members would help alleviate workload and thus would shorten the timetable of the project.</p>




<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>I would improve my productivity and efficiency ahead of time by firstly making sure I had to necessary skills needed as trying to learn as I go has been an inefficient use of my time. Issues that I had that affect productivity are that I didn’t take enough breaks with left my eyes feeling tired. In the future I would take regular breaks. Another was I would improve productivity and efficiency would be to better estimate my timescales on the project.

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>

<p>If I could do anything differently next time I would give myself more time for the project, as there was a skill gap that caused me to scale back on features. If I had more time I believe I would be able to do more research and improve my skill set.</p>


<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<p>Regular testing is very important in these kind of projects, constantly checking your code and if it displays correctly will lead to regular problem solving if there are any issues. This way you are fixing errors as you go which is more efficient as opposed to fixing all the errors at the end of the project.</p>
