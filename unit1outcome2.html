<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h1>
        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, 
        Trello</h2> 
        
        <p>The I.T tools I have been using for this website project include VSC (visual studio code) which is a source code editor developed by microsoft  and Trello (trello.com.) which is a web based list making application to help in project planning. I am very happy with the tools I have chosen as Trello has helped me stay on task and VSC understands html and CSS.</p>
        
        
        
        
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        
        <p>I feel VSC(visual studio code) was a very appropriate IT tool as it understands various coding languages as I am using multiple to build the website HTML and CSS respectively. Trello has also been a useful tool as It makes me aware of what I have done, what I am doing and what I need to do to finish the project.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>

        <p>Am I happy with my final project? Not especially I am disappointed at the basic art design and poor implementation of features as of typing I cannot get a banner to work so won’t make the final product. If I could change anything it would be to definitely have that feature working and have more pages to go through but in the interest of finishing on time I had to limit the scope of the website</p>

        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2> 

<p>There are several ways I could improve my project. I would have liked to have had each question have its own page but time constraints put a stop to that. I would have also liked to have more features on my website.</p>



<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

<p>In preparing adequate content for the site I researched and answer the questions for the unit outcomes. I used HTML and CSS which are coding languages to edit and format the content on the website so that it was easy to navigate and everything was clear. I have constantly been test my code and how it displays so the website with have no errors and is fit for purpose.
