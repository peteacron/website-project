        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

I have designed my website to have 5 pages with a navigation bar at the top that doesn’t scroll. Each page will be filled with unit outcomes.I have used various fonts and formatting to break up the questions and outcomes. I over all wanted a clean simple design that was easy to read. I wanted there to be margins on either side on the page to make the text look cleaner, but then come to the realisation that my inspiration came from my using an ad-blocker and most sites that I looked at the spaces were actually where the ad’s would go. So as a happy accident I have space for adverts if I chose to monetize the website.


            <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2> 
             
            <p>When creating a website you need to be aware of copyright laws and to not to break them. Copyright law is used to protect created contend (images,videos etc.) from unlawful sharing and copy without the creators consent. Breaking copyright law runs the risk of legal action and financial penalties. Data protection is also something to think about when creating a website.</p>
             
             
             
             
            <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
            people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can 
            overcome
            Them</h2>
             
            <p>Accessibility is hugely important to a websites design. There are various disabilities that should be taken into account there a visual  auditory and motor function impairments that all need various solutions. There are systems available to help users with these conditions access web pages such as braille terminals screen readers for people with limited eyesight and adaptive keyboards with custom inputs for those that need them.</p>
             
             
            <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
            
            <p>There are many different file types that are appropriate for websites each with their own properties. For example MP3 and MP4 files handle audio and video respectively. JPEG is the most commonly used image file for websites pictures and backgrounds but when it comes to logos png is preferred as it handles transparency. Memory constraints and compatibility have to be taken into account as you run the risk of websites taking longer than you would like to load or even worse not displaying correctly.</p>
