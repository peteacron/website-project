<p>But seriously. In an attempt to improve my skills set and employability I am currently taking a course at <a href="wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> where I am learning coding and web design. In the short time on the course I have learned the basics of Python which is a coding language and used it to create a text adventure as a team project.The tech industry is a quickly moving and expanding space and something that I am attempting to become apart of.</p>
