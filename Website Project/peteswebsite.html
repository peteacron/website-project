<h2>About Me</h2>
 
 
<p>My name is Peter Richards and I like people places and things.</p>
 
<img src = "aprilludgate.gif" alt = "April Ludgate gif here">
 
<p>But seriously. In an attempt to improve my skills set and employability I am currently taking a course at<a href="wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>where I am learning coding and web design. In the short time on the course I have learned the basics of Python which is a coding language and used it to create a text adventure as a team project.The tech industry is a quickly moving and expanding space and something that I am attempting to become apart of.</p>  
 

<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
 
 
 
 
<p><abbr title="Information Technology">I.T</abbr>in modern business is extremely important as many companies run the risk of becoming unprofitable and obsolete if they don’t keep up with emerging technologies.<a href="www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-blockbuster?r=US&IR=T#today-the-blockbuster-franchise-has-dwindled-to-just-one-store-in-bend-oregon-15 " target="_blank">Blockbuster went from over 9,000 stores globally to now just one</a>,due to not being able to keep up with emerging technologies at the time Keeping up with advances in I.T is a necessity to a modern business's growth and sustainability. A Florist for example up to date with I.T would be able to offer their customers flexibility in how they pay with products and services like PayPal and Apple and Google pay.

<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
 
<p>There are many parts that make up a successful digital project. Research and good planning are arguably the two most important. How do you know what tools are needed to complete a digital project, you research. Google.com or similar search engines are valuable tools to leverage in finding out what kind of programmes will be suitable to your digital project and what skills are best suited to work in tandem with them. Failure to plan is planning to fail, when projects have deadlines planning your time and workload accordingly is the difference between success and failure.    
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h2>
 
<p>I will be using the Kanban method and utilizing a Trello board[4] to plan out and set tasks with the aim of creating a website. First thing I will need to do is to learn HTML and CSS. How do I add images how to I link to other pages, these are the kind of things I need to learn. I am also planning on doing research into what makes a good website what is the most important factor? Is it the design, usability, compatibility. I will take and use what I have learned to try and achieve a modern looking website.

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
projects to fail? Why?</h2> 
 
<p>As with any endeavor, digital projects run the risk of failure. Some examples of what can cause a digital project to fail are over ambition and not being flexible in your planning. If you don’t have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) you run the risk of not being able to scale back your project into something financially viable if issues with deadlines and funding happen. With the quickly changing landscape of I.T and market trends being inflexible in your planning is a recipe for disaster. The need to pivot and adapt to emerging technologies is vital to being compatible and competitive when you project is completed and put into use.</p>
 
 
<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
 
<p>How do you select the right kind of technology? First thing you need to do is look at what you are trying to accomplish and research accordingly. You need to know you have the right tools for the right job. Some important attributes of your chosen I.T system are flexibility and scalability as you need to big quick moving and able to grow with minimal disruption. Creating a system network  allowing multiple computers to share internet access software and hardware will allow users to work better as a team.</p>   
 
 
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and
GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
 
<p>To keep my project on track I have utilised Trello.com[ ] which is a website that utilizes the kanban system of planning that helps you keep on schedule and to prevent task bottlenecking. If you are utilizing Tello correctly you will cleary know what tasks you have completed what still needs to be done and the timescale to complete the tasks. Another tool I am utilizing is github.com which is a cloud based website designed to store and manage code. Github has helped keep my code organized as I iterate upon it and be able to roll back to previous versions with minimal disruption.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
GDPR impact digital projects?</h2> 
 
 
<p>There are many legal guidelines and constraints that can affect digital projects. The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPD) “is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU)”[ ] The most important aspect of GDPD is that you are required to to notify what data you will be collecting and asking them to opt-in. A common example of this is websites disclosing the collection of cookies.

<h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1
1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2> 
 
<p>When creating a website you need to be aware of copyright laws and to not to break them. Copyright law is used to protect created contend (images,videos etc.) from unlawful sharing and copy without the creators consent. Breaking copyright law runs the risk of legal action and financial penalties. Data protection is also something to think about when creating a website.</p>
 
 
 
 
<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can 
overcome
Them</h2>
 
<p>Accessibility is hugely important to a websites design. There are various disabilities that should be taken into account there a visual  auditory and motor function impairments that all need various solutions. There are systems available to help users with these conditions access web pages such as braille terminals screen readers for people with limited eyesight and adaptive keyboards with custom inputs for those that need them.</p>
 
 
<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>

<p>There are many different file types that are appropriate for websites each with their own properties. For example MP3 and MP4 files handle audio and video respectively. JPEG is the most commonly used image file for websites pictures and backgrounds but when it comes to logos png is preferred as it handles transparency. Memory constraints and compatibility have to be taken into account as you run the risk of websites taking longer than you would like to load or even worse not displaying correctly.</p>





<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2
• 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, 
Trello</h2> 

<p>The I.T tools I have been using for this website project include VSC (visual studio code) which is a source code editor developed by microsoft  and Trello (trello.com.) which is a web based list making application to help in project planning. I am very happy with the tools I have chosen as Trello has helped me stay on task and VSC understands html and CSS.</p>




<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

<p>I feel VSC(visual studio code) was a very appropriate IT tool as it understands various coding languages as I am using multiple to build the website HTML and CSS respectively. Trello has also been a useful tool as It makes me aware of what I have done, what I am doing and what I need to do to finish the project.</p>



<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>



<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2> 

<p>There are several ways I could improve my project. I would have liked to have had each question have its own page but time constraints put a stop to that. I would have also liked to have more features on my website.</p>



<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>




<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h1>

<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

<p>The tool I used in terms of productivity and efficiency was Trello and it has it’s benefits and drawbacks. The benefits include having a visual representation of what my tasks were. The drawbacks were that even though I had my tasks laid out I wasn’t sure how long everything would take so making an accurate time table was difficult. If this was a group project I feel as a whole, the project would be run more efficiently. Being able to delegate tasks between team members would help alleviate workload and thus would shorten the timetable of the project.</p>




<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>



<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>

<p>If I could do anything differently next time I would give myself more time for the project, as there was a skill gap that caused me to scale back on features. If I had more time I believe I would be able to do more research and improve my skill set.</p>



<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
