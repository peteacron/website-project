<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

<p> Information Technology (I.T) in modern business is extremely important as 
    many companies run the risk of becoming unprofitable and obsolete if they
    donâ€™t keep up with emerging technologies. Blockbuster went from over 9,000
    stores globally to now just one, [2] due to not being able to keep up with
    emerging technologies at the time Keeping up with advances in I.T is a necessity
    to a modern business's growth and sustainability. A Florist for example up to date
    with I.T would be able to offer their customers flexibility in how they pay with
    products and services like PayPal and Apple and Google pay.
