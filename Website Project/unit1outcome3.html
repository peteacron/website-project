<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

<p>The tool I used in terms of productivity and efficiency was Trello and it has it’s benefits and drawbacks. The benefits include having a visual representation of what my tasks were. The drawbacks were that even though I had my tasks laid out I wasn’t sure how long everything would take so making an accurate time table was difficult. If this was a group project I feel as a whole, the project would be run more efficiently. Being able to delegate tasks between team members would help alleviate workload and thus would shorten the timetable of the project.</p>




<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>



<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>

<p>If I could do anything differently next time I would give myself more time for the project, as there was a skill gap that caused me to scale back on features. If I had more time I believe I would be able to do more research and improve my skill set.</p>
