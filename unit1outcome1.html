<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
 
 
 
 
<p><abbr title="Information Technology">I.T</abbr> in modern business is extremely important as many companies run the risk of becoming unprofitable and obsolete if they don’t keep up with emerging technologies.<a href="www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-blockbuster?r=US&IR=T#today-the-blockbuster-franchise-has-dwindled-to-just-one-store-in-bend-oregon-15 " target="_blank">Blockbuster went from over 9,000 stores globally to now just one</a>,due to not being able to keep up with emerging technologies at the time Keeping up with advances in I.T is a necessity to a modern business's growth and sustainability. A Florist for example up to date with I.T would be able to offer their customers flexibility in how they pay with products and services like PayPal and Apple and Google pay.

<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
 
<p>There are many parts that make up a successful digital project. Research and good planning are arguably the two most important. How do you know what tools are needed to complete a digital project, you research. Google.com or similar search engines are valuable tools to leverage in finding out what kind of programmes will be suitable to your digital project and what skills are best suited to work in tandem with them. Failure to plan is planning to fail, when projects have deadlines planning your time and workload accordingly is the difference between success and failure.    
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h2>
 
<p>I will be using the Kanban method and utilizing a Trello board[4] to plan out and set tasks with the aim of creating a website. First thing I will need to do is to learn HTML and CSS. How do I add images how to I link to other pages, these are the kind of things I need to learn. I am also planning on doing research into what makes a good website what is the most important factor? Is it the design, usability, compatibility. I will take and use what I have learned to try and achieve a modern looking website.

<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
projects to fail? Why?</h2> 
 
<p>As with any endeavor, digital projects run the risk of failure. Some examples of what can cause a digital project to fail are over ambition and not being flexible in your planning. If you don’t have an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) you run the risk of not being able to scale back your project into something financially viable if issues with deadlines and funding happen. With the quickly changing landscape of I.T and market trends being inflexible in your planning is a recipe for disaster. The need to pivot and adapt to emerging technologies is vital to being compatible and competitive when you project is completed and put into use.</p>
 
 
<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
 
<p>How do you select the right kind of technology? First thing you need to do is look at what you are trying to accomplish and research accordingly. You need to know you have the right tools for the right job. Some important attributes of your chosen I.T system are flexibility and scalability as you need to big quick moving and able to grow with minimal disruption. Creating a system network  allowing multiple computers to share internet access software and hardware will allow users to work better as a team.</p>   
 
 
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and
GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
 
<p>To keep my project on track I have utilised Trello.com[ ] which is a website that utilizes the kanban system of planning that helps you keep on schedule and to prevent task bottlenecking. If you are utilizing Tello correctly you will cleary know what tasks you have completed what still needs to be done and the timescale to complete the tasks. Another tool I am utilizing is github.com which is a cloud based website designed to store and manage code. Github has helped keep my code organized as I iterate upon it and be able to roll back to previous versions with minimal disruption.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
GDPR impact digital projects?</h2> 

<p>There are many legal guidelines and constraints that can affect digital projects. The <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> <a href=" https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.asp" target="_blank"> “is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU)”</a> The most important aspect of GDPD is that you are required to to notify what data you will be collecting and asking them to opt-in. A common example of this is websites disclosing the collection of cookies.
